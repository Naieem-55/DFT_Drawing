# Drawing Portraits using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Epicycles

This repository contains code to create animations of portraits using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and epicycles. 


## Overview

The code in this repository allows you to generate animations of portraits using DFT and epicycles. It takes an input image, extracts the edges, computes the Fourier coefficients, and then animates the drawing process using epicycles.

## Features

- Input any grayscale image to generate a portrait animation.
- Adjustable parameters for controlling the animation, such as the number of Fourier coefficients and animation speed.
- Save the generated animation as an MP4 file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- tqdm
- scipy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Naieem-55/DFT_Drawing.git


## Usage

1. Place your grayscale image in the `images` directory.
2. Run the script `main.py`:


3. Follow the prompts to select your input image and adjust animation parameters.
4. The generated animation will be saved as `output.mp4` in the `output` directory.
